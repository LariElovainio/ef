				<h2>Better Without Mercury</h2>
				<p>Elena·Elovainio is partnering up with Ethical Metalsmiths and Fairmined in order to clean 400 tons of mercury contaminated soil at the La Fortaleza artisanal mine in Colombia.</p>
				<p>La Fortaleza stopped using mercury to process its gold ore in 2017, but after decades of mining with mercury, contaminated soils remain. Mercury is a bio-magnifying neurotoxin that knows no boundaries.</p>
				<p>Together we can help the mining association clean the land and allow it to continue towards the path of responsible mining, providing all of us with clean gold that we can all be proud&nbsp;of.</p>
				<p>You can donate through <a href="//ethicalmetalsmiths.org/better-without-mercury/">the project page</a>.</p>
